# Shipping your Hardware Projects

Now that you have the design files, it's time to actually submit your project. Here's the step-by-step on how to do that.

## 1. Make sure you have all of your project files!

First off - check that all your project's files are actually in the repository! This includes a full CAD assembly in .STEP format, your PCB source files, and your firmware! This ensures that other people will actually be able to replicate your project

## 2. Organize the different files!

Next, you should organize all your different files!

I recommend making 3 folders - one called "CAD", one called "PCB", and one called "firmware"

Drag and drop your files into their respective folders. Here's an example of what they should look like!

```
example_project
├── README.md
├── assets
│   ├── logo.png
│   └── screenshot.png
├── cad
│   └── example_project_full_cad.step
├── firmware
│   ├── Makefile
│   └── firmware.c
└── pcb
    ├── example_pcb.kicad_pcb
    ├── example_pcb.kicad_prl
    ├── example_pcb.kicad_pro
    └── example_pcb.kicad_sch
```

(don't worry too much about the filenames - just make sure the general structure matches!)

## 3. Make a BOM.csv file!

Now, write a BOM.csv so that everyone can see where to get parts for your project! It'll also help you order all the parts once you actually get your grant.

There's a template [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1maI6o3gMH7iFf2YkcOIJNg3B32JRLoNRscTOKz6hCpg/edit?usp=sharing) if you need

## 4. Write a README.md about your project!

A README.md file is what ties your project together! It should include a short description of your project (what it does, how it works, why you made it), and also screenshots of your project!

Make sure to include a screenshot of your PCB(s)/wiring diagram if applicable - it makes reviewing way easier for us and cuts down on time!

One snippet you can add to your project is this. It adds a PCB button to your README that opens your repository's PCB!

## 5. Submit!

Once you're done with your project, you're ready to submit!

If you just finished a _design_ and are looking for funding, fill out [this form](https://forms.hackclub.com/outpost-design)

If you went straight for a build and want to submit for Stardust, hang tight! Support for shipping hardware on the platform is currently in development and coming soon.
