module IdvHelper
  # Ported from Flavortown's HomeHelper#id_verification_ui_for — maps a user's
  # verification status to how the owner-facing IDV indicators present it.
  #
  # Statuses (User#verification_status enum): needs_submission, pending,
  # verified, ineligible (ineligible == rejected / poor quality).
  #
  # Returns nil when there's nothing to flag (no user, or already verified).
  #   variant – :warning (pending / under review) or :danger (action needed)
  #   line    – the owner-facing "why your stuff is private" sentence
  #   cta     – label for the link that opens the verify popup
